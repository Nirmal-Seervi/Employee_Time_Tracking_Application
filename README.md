# Employee_Time_Tracking_Application

The Employee Time Tracking Application is designed to help employees track and manage their daily tasks and working hours. It includes features for task management, role-based access control, and graphical reporting through charts.

## Features

- Task Management:
  - Employees can add, edit, and delete tasks.
  - Task details include employee name, role, project, date, time duration, task category (e.g., Meeting, Training), and task description.
  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  - Associate: Manage personal tasks and view reports.
  - Admin: View task reports for any employee or project.
  
- Duration Tracking: Displays the total hours worked in daily, weekly, and monthly formats.

- Chart Visualizations:
  - Associates can view their tasks as pie charts (daily) or bar charts (weekly/monthly).
  - Admins can view charts for any selected employee or project.

## Technical Considerations

- **No duplicate task entries**: Tasks for the same date and time cannot overlap.
- **Maximum task duration**: Each task's duration is capped at 8 hours per day.
